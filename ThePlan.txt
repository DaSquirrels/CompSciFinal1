The Plan:

Genre: Pirates

You start as a lone pirate, but first you must name yourself and your top 5 shipmates.

What about starting as a privateer? You work for the english and steal from the spanish
As a privateer we could have the crew pre-named as well
^Even as a pirate we could have crew names pre-generated, although your crew
    would be much more diverse and we'd need more names

Pirates:
    Pros:
        Wikipedia Page is nice
        No one will question the historical accuracy
    Cons: 
        There's no distinct goal to play for (unless we want to make one up)
Privateers:
    Pros:
        You'll have an actually mission for the game (pay off your investor)
        You know your whole crew will be the same nationality (easier to generate names)
    Cons:
        It'll be more obvious if we're historically innacurate

** Disclaimer: We won't try to be historically accurate **
