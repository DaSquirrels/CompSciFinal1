The Plan:

Genre: Pirates

You start as a lone pirate, but first you must name yourself and your top 5 shipmates.

What about starting as a privateer? You work for the english and steal from the spanish
As a privateer we could have the crew pre-named as well
^Even as a pirate we could have crew names pre-generated, although your crew
    would be much more diverse and we'd need more names
